This is an nginx module designed to display notices of downtime, ignoring the
usual semantics of HTTP methods GET, PUT, and POST, and returning a fixed
response body for every request. It was originally written for the Causes on
Facebook application, since every Facebook request is a POST (regardless of the
intended effects, if any, on server state).

To compile this module, you must recompile nginx itself. Once you are
comfortable with configuring and compiling nginx, you can use this module by
adding "--add-module=/path/to/this/directory" to your configure options.

For example, to compile nginx with the default options plus this module, you
could type:

 $ ./configure --add-module=/path/to/this/directory

Then compile and install nginx as you normally would.

Have fun!

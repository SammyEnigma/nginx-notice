Greetings!

This is the README for nginx-notice version 1.

______________________________________________________________________
About

Nginx-notice is an nginx module designed to display notices of downtime,
ignoring the usual semantics of HTTP methods GET, PUT, and POST, and returning
a fixed response body for every request. It was originally written for the
Causes on Facebook application, since every Facebook request is a POST
(regardless of the intended effects, if any, on server state).

______________________________________________________________________
Installation

To compile this module, you must recompile nginx itself. Once you are
comfortable with configuring and compiling nginx, you can use this module by
adding "--add-module=/path/to/this/directory" to your configure options.

For example, to compile nginx with the default options plus this module, you
could type:

 $ ./configure --add-module=/path/to/this/directory

Then compile and install nginx as you normally would.

Bugs

  * There is a hard limit on the size of the notice that this module will send,
    by default 100KiB. You can change this by editing the source file.
  * This module does not log errors.

That's all. Have fun!
